# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Datasets consist of 2 reviews, namely positive and negative reviews.

The goal: Discover the highest accuracy for sentiment analysis

In order to achive it, I use 4 different approaches, such as:
- Using NLTK library for NLP and SVM for classification
- Using Spacy library for NLP and SVM for classification
- Using NLTK library for NLP and Deep learning for classification
- Using Spacy library for NLP and Deep Learning for classification

- Note: Deep Learning Classification ones are on progress
